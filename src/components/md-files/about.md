Hi there, I'm Kexi. I’m a web developer based in China, working mostly with Vue, React, and Node.js. I enjoy building clean and useful web apps, and I'm always learning and trying to improve.

Most of the posts here are used for self learning. Some documents and examples are copied from other places like MDN, Stack Overflow and GitHub. Welcome to my blog and feel free to reach out.
