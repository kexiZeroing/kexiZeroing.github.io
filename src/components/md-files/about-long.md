Hi there, I'm Kexi. I’m a web developer based in China, working mostly with Vue, React, and Node.js. I enjoy building clean and useful web apps, and I'm always learning and trying to improve.

I’m hoping to connect with more developers around the world, just to exchange ideas, maybe join some online or offline meetups. If there's a chance to collaborate or explore a remote opportunity, that would be amazing.

Most of the blog posts are used for self learning. Some documents and examples are copied from other places like MDN, Stack Overflow and GitHub.

1. The goal is to build a second brain.
2. The best way to commit something to long-term memory is to periodically review it, gradually increasing the time between reviews.

I don't fit the stereotype of a genius programmer who lives and breathes code. Instead, my passion lies in the relentless pursuit of understanding and the thrill of exploration. I'm that person who dives deep into documentation, follows blog posts, and watches video tutorials. Sleep and meals take a backseat when I'm in the zone, dissecting problems and piecing together solutions.

But let's be real. I'm not an all-knowing oracle. No one is. And that's okay. I've learned to set realistic expectations. I'm not here to conquer every programming language or memorize every framework. Instead, I focus on what matters: growth, impact, and happiness. Money? Sure, it's essential, but it's not the sole purpose. I want to create, contribute, and connect. And if I occasionally feel that void, I remind myself—it's okay. Take a relief.

I call myself "a lifelong learner". Learning isn't a straight highway; Interest waxes and wanes, energy fluctuates, and time slips through our fingers. But the journey—the messy, imperfect, exhilarating journey—is where the magic truly happens.

Becoming a good engineer is about collecting experience. To experience is to learn, and write about what you learn. The journey of rebuilding my blog with Astro out of curiosity starts here.
