From Greg Brockman: Software development is undergoing a renaissance in front of our eyes. If you haven't used the tools recently, you likely are underestimating what you're missing. Since December, there's been a step function improvement in what tools like Codex can do. Some great engineers at OpenAI yesterday told me that their job has fundamentally changed since December. Prior to then, they could use Codex for unit tests; now it writes essentially all the code and does a great deal of their operations and debugging. Not everyone has yet made that leap, but it's usually because of factors besides the capability of the model.

From Andrej Karpathy: I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually. Generation (writing code) and discrimination (reading code) are different capabilities in the brain. Largely due to all the little mostly syntactic details involved in programming, you can review code just fine even if you struggle to write it.

From Ryan Dahl: This has been said a thousand times before, but allow me to add my own voice: the era of humans writing code is over. Disturbing for those of us who identify as SWEs, but no less true. That's not to say SWEs don't have work to do, but writing syntax directly is not it.

From Madison Kanna: For a long time i defined myself in part by the act of writing code. the pride in a hard-earned solution was part of who i was. now i watch AI accomplish in seconds what took me hours. i find myself caught between relief and mourning, awe and anxiety. the craft that shaped me is suddenly eclipsed by a machine. who am i now?

From Addy Osmani: The collapse of the implementation middle isn't making engineering less important but it's revealing what was always important: understanding problems so clearly that the code (now, the spec for our agents) becomes more obvious. As software engineers, our identity was never “the person who can write code” - it was “the person who can solve problems with software.”

From Boris Cherny: Pretty much 100% of our code is written by Claude Code + Opus 4.5. For me personally it has been 100% for two+ months now, I don’t even make small edits by hand. I shipped 22 PRs yesterday and 27 the day before, each one 100% written by Claude. Some were written from a CLI, some from the iOS app; others on the team code largely with the Claude Code app Slack or with the Desktop app. I think most of the industry will see similar stats in the coming months — it will take more time for some vs others. We will then start seeing similar stats for non-coding computer work also.
